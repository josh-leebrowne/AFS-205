                Our Mission
            </h1>
            <p class="about-us-body">
                Here at Longbow Dynamics we use cutting edge technology to understand and communicate with toasters.
                The ability to understand the mind of a toaster has allowed us to make cutting edge advances in the field 
                of convection appliances. Along with this massive undertaking, we also have staff of clinical personnel
                to monitor the psychological state of the toaster and toaster-ovens while we study them. Our investors and shareholders
                are extremely intent on solving the problems of the every day toaster and toaster-oven.
