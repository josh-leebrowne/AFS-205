                Longbow Dynamics is a tip of the spear research and development cohort designed to
                combat the modern problems of todays toasters and toaster-ovens. Here at Longbow Dynamics,
                we believe in the ethical use of toasters and toaster-ovens, and feel compelled to revoluntionize
                the way we use them. In our eyes, toasters and toaster-ovens aren't just samll kitchen appliances, they're
                part of the family. That's why we make it our number one priority to understand the masterfully crafted works
                of art.
