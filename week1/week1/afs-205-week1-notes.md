2. Web Infrastructure & Server Deployment / Course Outline
3. Web Server Recap
4. Q & A

### 2. How To Ask a "Good" Question

Asking a good question is not only for yourself but helps the person helping you quickly and efficently figure out what in the hell is going on in your jumbled mess of a project and how to help you through it. At first this will be your support system at BU, next most likely stack overflow, and lastly your mentor or senior level devs. The very first thing your senior dev will ask you will be did you google it.

#### Contents of a "good" question

1) Code snippets of every file involved. If full stack MERN this could be 5-10 ... all labeled on the top with a comment of the name of the file. Including the commented out code of your "tries."

2) A description of the problem you are trying to solve, or what you are tryign to accomplish. Think â€” how do I do x ..... tell us what x is.

3) What you specifically have done to try and solve this problem.

4) What error you are getting and any associated screenshot of that error.

### 3. Web Infrastructure & Server Deployment - NGINX, Apache, & Docker

In this course, we will be learning how to create servers and reverse proxies using popular web communication protocols within [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/), [Apache](https://www.docker.com/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). We will build up to our own server configuration and deployment to the cloud. This course leans heavily on the associated e-book and I highly suggest you keep up with or get ahead with the assigned readings. Most of the exercises adn assignments are taken from the book so please use that as your main resource.

We will be meeting for lecture on odd weeks (weeks 1, 3, 5, & 7) at 7 am and 7 pm (PT). My office hours are even weeks (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) on Wednesdays at 5 pm (PT).

     **PLEASE NOTE** The last morning lecture in week 7 has been moved to that Saturday the 30th of July at the same time, 7 am PDT.

## Web Server Recap

The [Web Infrastructures Quiz](https://bryanuniversity.instructure.com/courses/11619/quizzes/62195?module_item_id=686448) in week 1 does a great job at overviewing modern web infrastructure but, I wanted to take a moment to overview servers in the context of web applciations together.

> Web servers are considered stateless. What does that mean? Can you think of ways to add "state" to this data flow?
